This really sucks.

That app was amazing and so much better than what they are providing.

I donâ€™t want this to end. Make it not end?

This really sucks, man :'((((

It was a beautiful thing to happen to students

C'est la vie I guess

Peace,

Aw man I canâ€™t believe that I absolutely loved your system it was a million times better than the college one. Who do I write to to protest this? because I really want to. Very unfair

---

Thatâ€™s a shame ðŸ˜­ that was the mostly used college app ðŸ˜£

---

Was good while it lasted. Thanks! _

---

Nooooooooooooo

What do they expect us to use instead ??

Thank you for providing the service for as long as it did work and best of luck with what brilliant ideas you'll come up next!

Tell the college to get fucked

Dear Rory,

Who may I direct my frustration at? Is there a department to blame for this and what is their email? I'm pretty sure if you asked all of us to send in emails people would. Public pressure may be enough to reverse this decision. Thanks for a great service!

Sincerely,

_

What an absolute travesty. If there's anything that can be done to make this not happen please contact me, I can rally a crowd in your favour. I can't bear going back to screenshots.

Thanks anyway for your work and good luck mate.

Heya Rory,

It is a pity to hear this :(

Thank you for making one semester of my life much MUCH simpler!

TRINITY BUREAUCRACY AT ITS FINEST. JUST LIKE THEM TO SHUT DOWN A FUNCTIONING, POPULAR, HELPFUL SERVICE IN ORDER TO FURTHER THEIR OWN CONVOLUTED, OPPRESSIVE CAUSE. THEY COULD'VE JUST INTEGRATED IT INTO THEIR OWN SYSTEM, BUT NO, THEY'D RATHER NOT REWARD SOMEONE FOR CIRCUMVENTING THEIR AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, NO MATTER HOW INNOVATIVE AND GROUNDBREAKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. WE HAVE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES AND WE WILL SAY IT A MILLION TIMES AGAIN: OVERTHROW THE BOURGEOISIE, SEIZE THE MEANS OF ADMINISTRATION, AND PROGRESS. YOUR COMRADES WILL FLY THE TCAL FLAG AT HALF MAST TOMORROW. YOUR EFFORTS HAVE NOT GONE UNRECOGNISED. THERE IS NO NOBLER DEATH THAN THAT OF A MARTYR.

WE WON'T FORGET YOU,

LOVE,

COMMSOC

Nooooooo. Sad times my friend


---

---

Just saw the email...gutted to say the least..

Dear Rory,

I am deeply saddened by this news. The service will be greatly missed.

Regards,
