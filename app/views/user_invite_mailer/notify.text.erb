What is Tcal?

- Tcal keeps time and module changes in sync.


What's the point?

- iPhone and Android come with a calendar app. Tcal makes use of it.
- Know what you have now and where, without even unlocking your phone.
- Manage the rest of your day/night in your calendar alongside your college schedule
